# 3D Graphics Renderer

Welcome to the 3D Graphics Renderer! This web application allows users to create and manipulate 3D shapes in a browser using Three.js, a powerful JavaScript library for 3D graphics.

## Features

- Add various 3D shapes: Cube, Sphere, Cylinder, Cone, Torus, Triangle Prism, Octahedron, and Torus Knot.
- Rotate and scale objects using sliders.
- Auto-rotate objects with adjustable speed.
- Toggle wireframe mode for a different visual perspective.
- Select and delete objects from the scene.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality and interactivity.
- **Three.js**: Library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser.

## Getting Started

To run the 3D Graphics Renderer locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/3D-Graphics-Renderer.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd 3D-Graphics-Renderer
   ```
3. **Open the index.html file in your web browser**:
   - You can simply double-click the index.html file or use a local server for better performance.
If you have Python installed, you can run a simple HTTP server:
   - For Python 3:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server
   ```
   - Then, open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000.

4. **Usage**
   - Click on the buttons to add shapes to the scene.
   - Use the sliders to adjust rotation and scale.
   - Check the "Auto" checkbox to enable automatic rotation for each axis.
   - Click on an object to select it, and then use the delete button to remove it from the scene.
   - Toggle wireframe mode to see the underlying geometry of the shapes.
